For this project, their data set scraped on July 21, 2019, on the city of Edinburgh, Scotland, will be used. It contains information on all Edinburgh Airbnb listings that were live on the site on that date (over 14,000). Here's a direct link.\n\nThe data has certain limitations. The most noticeable one is that it scrapes the advertised price rather than the actual price paid by previous customers. More accurate data is available for a fee in sites like AirDNA.\n\nEach row in the data set is a listing available for rental in Airbnb's site for the specific city (observations). The columns describe different characteristics of each listing (features).\n\nSome of the more important features this project will look into are the following:\n\naccommodates: the number of guests the rental can accommodate\nbedrooms: number of bedrooms included in the rental\nbathrooms: number of bathrooms included in the rental\nbeds: number of beds included in the rental\nprice: nightly price for the rental\nminimum_nights: minimum number of nights a guest can stay for the rental\nmaximum_nights: maximum number of nights a guest can stay for the rental\nnumber_of_reviews: number of reviews that previous guests have left\nTo model the spatial relationship between Airbnb rental prices and property proximity to certain venues, we will use the Foursquare API to access the city's venues."}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
